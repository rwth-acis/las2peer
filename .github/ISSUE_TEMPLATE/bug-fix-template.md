Bug-related issues need to report how, when (how often) and where an issue occurs. To answer these questions, the following sections are defined:

1. **Summary** - A short description/story on how the issue was first encountered. Intended to be a more readable version of the next section.
2. **Bug Details** - A detailed explanation of the issue, structured in subsections:
   1. **What?** - A short statement of the problem.
   2. **Where?** - In which part of the system or an artifact of the system is the bug occuring? What parts of the system is it influencing?
   3. **When?/How often?** - When does the bug occur? This can be in regards to some causing event or just at particular time; state it. Does it occur regularly? If so, how often?
   4. **How?/Current state** - Here an example of a bug-producing scenario should be given, i.e. the steps that produced the bug. If there is an artifact produced by the bug, show it as well.
3. *(Optional)* **Fixed state** - If a correct state of the system/artifact is known, describe it here.
